<!-- The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. 
  it can be accessed with js.

  A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
  A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

  <h2>My First Page</h2>

  <p id="demo"></p>

  <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
  </script>
  
<!--  In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property. 
      The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>.
